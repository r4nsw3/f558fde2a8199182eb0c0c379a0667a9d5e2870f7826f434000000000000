  |   Zenith is an action RPG that combines that feel of the golden era     |
  |   RPG games with a generous dose of humor and parody. The game counts   |
  |   with a solid story which unfolds in a fantasy world populated by      |
  |   dozens of unorthodox characters. Adventuring, exploring ruins,        |
  |   accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world... you've    |
  |   done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he's a bit fed up with   |
  |   the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all,      |
  |   but he's in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some        |
  |   peace and quiet. But that's not easy to get with all those            |
  |   spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and          |
  |   ruining the pavement. Specially when you're trying to keep a          |
  |   dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one      |
  |   complex.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Explore a world of possibilities in a fully-realized fantasy         |
  |   realm. And one of those world map things we used to love.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Face huge bosses, dangerous foes, and angsty teenagers.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Find tons of parodies and pop culture references. Let's see if you   |
  |   can recognise them all.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Save the world. Sorta. Granted, it's a bit of a clich√©. But hey,     |
  |   it works.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an   |
  |   all-powerful "final blow"-type move.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player   |
  |   campaign.                                                             |
